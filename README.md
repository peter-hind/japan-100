## The Idea

This project was an attempt to use the Japanese Philosophy of Ikigai to choose an App design that would I find fulfilling.

Being a Japanophile myself and a near-native speaker with a love of travel, I was perfectly positioned to bring some less well-known destinations to the table. I'm also a bit of a map nerd... so win-win!

## Usage

After signing up, users can select a list of 100 famous things to display on the map. Currently there are five lists available, but there are MANY more!

Clicking on a feature will bring up an information section to the right, with the option to mark the site as visited (or not!)

Users can also make use of the list view to track their completion of certain lists.

## The Future
### Issues and Updates

This project was created to give access to the Japan 100s for a western audience. The biggest hurdle going forward is the accumulation of all the relevant data - some isn't even currently available in English. 
That being said, I plan to implent a number of other features:

#### Bugs

There is an issue with map layer selection not persisting when switching between the map and list views. Simply switching layers and back again is a temporary fix until a better solution is implemented.
