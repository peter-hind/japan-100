# Japan Completionist
## An app for Japanophiles and travel enthusiasts to get the most out of their time in the land of the rising sun.

The app allows users to log in and track their progress visiting and experiencing all Japan has to offer.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 - First time users create an avatar and a family

🙆🏻‍♀️ - Other family members then join that family

👩‍👦 - Users are defined as either Parent or Child - Parent has admin role

🙎🏻‍♂️ - Parents can create chores and rewards

🧒🏻 - Kids can take on chores and claim rewards - but parental approval is required!

💏 - Parents can assign chores directly if necessary (in case the chore is... boring 😒)

## The Future
### Issues and Updates

This project was originally developed under a 5 day time constraint. Believe it or not, it doesn't yet have all the functionality we want! The following updates are in the pipeline:

* React Native rebuild for mobile applications
* Multiple Avatar sets
* Reward and chore editing
* Confirmation modals for important choices
* Shared Family options
* Chore urgency for points bonus
* Diminishing returns on regularly completed chores

#### Bugs

We are aware of some issues logging in / signing up on certain browsers, and are working to fix the problems.
Given the quick nature of the product, some of the codebase is in need of major overhaul/refactoring, which we will undertake as we implement new features.
